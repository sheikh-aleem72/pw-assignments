task: Explain the git workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository.
Ans: 
	Git is a widely used distributed version control system that employs a specific workflow consisting of three main components: the working directory, the staging area (also known as the index), and the repository. These elements work in harmony to manage and track changes in a project's source code. Here's a detailed explanation of the Git workflow:

Working Directory:
The working directory is the root folder where you create, edit, and organize your project's files.
It represents the current state of your project, including both tracked and untracked files.
Changes to files in the working directory are not automatically recorded by Git.

Staging Area (Index):
The staging area acts as an intermediate space between the working directory and the repository.
It allows you to select and prepare specific changes or files for the next commit.
Files added to the staging area are in a "pending" state, ready for inclusion in the next commit.
This selective staging is a critical feature that lets you commit only the changes you want.

Repository:
The repository is where Git stores the complete history of your project, including all committed changes.
It contains multiple branches (e.g., master, feature branches) representing different lines of development.
Commits made in the repository are permanent snapshots of the staged changes.
Each commit is associated with a unique identifier (SHA-1 hash) and includes information about the author, date, and a commit message.
