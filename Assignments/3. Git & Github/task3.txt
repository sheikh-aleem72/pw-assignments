Task: Explain what .gitignore is and why it's important in version control.
Ans:
.gitignore is a configuration file used in Git to specify files and directories that should be excluded from version control. It allows you to tell Git which files or patterns should not be tracked, preventing them from being added to the repository or included in commits.

The importance of .gitignore in version control can be summarized in four key points:

Exclude Unnecessary Files: It helps exclude files that are not relevant to the project or should not be shared with collaborators, such as build artifacts, log files, and temporary files.

Enhance Repository Clarity: .gitignore keeps the repository clean and focused, making it easier to understand and navigate. This enhances the clarity of the project's history and structure.

Prevent Sensitive Information: It's vital for preventing the inclusion of sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and configuration files containing credentials in the version control system. This ensures security and privacy.

Improve Collaboration: By specifying which files to ignore, .gitignore ensures that contributors to a project are working with the same set of files, reducing conflicts and discrepancies and facilitating collaboration.
