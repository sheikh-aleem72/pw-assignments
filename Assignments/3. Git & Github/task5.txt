Ans: 
Contributing to an open-source project on GitHub involves several steps:

Create a GitHub Account:
If you don't already have one, sign up for a GitHub account.

Fork the Repository:
Visit the project's GitHub repository and click the "Fork" button in the top right corner to create a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

Clone Your Fork:
Use Git to clone your fork to your local machine by running git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git.

Create a New Branch:
Create a new branch for your contribution with a descriptive name, e.g., git checkout -b my-feature.

Make Changes:
Make your desired changes to the code using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

Commit Your Changes:
Stage and commit your changes using git add . and git commit -m "Description of changes".

Push to Your Fork:
Push your changes to your GitHub fork with git push origin my-feature.

Create a Pull Request (PR):
On the original project's repository, click "New Pull Request." GitHub will compare your branch to the main project branch. Provide a clear description of your changes and submit the PR.

Discuss and Revise:
Collaborate with the project maintainers and contributors. They may request changes before merging.

Merge and Close:
Once your PR is approved, the maintainers will merge your changes into the main project. Your contribution is now part of the open-source project.
