Task: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Prove examples of situations where you would use each.
Ans: 

1. Nature:
JavaScript: A dynamic, high-level, and versatile scripting language used for adding interactivity to web pages.
Example: Implementing a real-time search feature on a website to filter and display results as the user types.
HTML: A static markup language used for structuring and presenting content on web pages.
Example: Defining the structure of a webpage with headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

2. Usage:
JavaScript: Utilized for programming logic, handling events, and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) in a web browser.
Example: Creating image sliders, form validation, or interactive maps.
HTML: Used for creating the overall structure and content of a webpage, defining elements and their layout.
Example: Crafting the layout of a blog post, structuring a navigation menu, or embedding multimedia content.

3. Execution:
JavaScript: Requires execution by a browser or a JavaScript engine. It runs as a client-side script, allowing for dynamic updates without page reload.
Example: Calculating and displaying the total price in a shopping cart as items are added or removed.
HTML: Parsed and rendered by the browser to display static content. It is primarily responsible for the presentation of web content.
Example: Displaying a list of items with descriptions and links.
