Task: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and multi-line comments.
Ans:
Comments in JavaScript are essential for code documentation, readability, and collaboration. They serve several important purposes:

Documentation: Comments provide explanations, instructions, and context to help developers understand the code's purpose and functionality.

Readability: Well-commented code is easier to follow and maintain, making it more accessible to you and other developers who may work on the code in the future.

Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable or isolate code segments for debugging purposes, without removing the code entirely.

Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:

Single-line comment: Use // to add comments that extend to the end of the line.
	// This is a single-line comment
	let x = 10; // Assign a value to variable x

Multi-line comment: Enclose multi-line comments between /* and */.
	/*
	This is a multi-line comment.
	It can span across multiple lines.
	Useful for longer explanations.
	*/
	let y = 20; // Assign a value to variable y
Effective use of comments can significantly enhance the clarity and maintainability of your JavaScript code
