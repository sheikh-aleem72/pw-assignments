Task: What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.
Ans: 
Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. They allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. The most common types of conditional statements are `if`, `else if`, and `else`. Here's a brief explanation of each with syntax and examples:

1. if statement:
   The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
Syntax:
  if (condition) {
       // Code to be executed if the condition is true
   }

2. if-else statement:
   The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.
Syntax:
   if (condition) {
       // Code to be executed if the condition is true
   } else {
       // Code to be executed if the condition is false
   }


3. if-else if-else statement:
   This statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence and execute different blocks of code based on the first true condition.
Syntax: 
   if (condition1) {
       // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
   } else if (condition2) {
       // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
   } else {
       // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
   }
