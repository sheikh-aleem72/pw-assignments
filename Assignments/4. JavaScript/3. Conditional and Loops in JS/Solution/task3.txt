Task: What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.
Ans: 
Loops in programming are control structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. Loops save you from writing redundant code and make your programs more efficient.

There are several types of loops in JavaScript, each serving different purposes. Here are the three main types:

1. for loop:
   The `for` loop is used when you know the number of iterations you want to perform.

   Syntax:
   for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
       // Code to be executed in each iteration
   }
   



2. while loop:
   The `while` loop is used when you don't know in advance how many times the loop will run, and the loop continues as long as the specified condition is true.

   Syntax:
   while (condition) {
       // Code to be executed while the condition is true
   }


 

3. do-while loop:
   The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the code inside the loop will execute at least once before checking the condition.

   Syntax:
   do {
       // Code to be executed
   } while (condition);




Loops are crucial for handling repetitive tasks, such as iterating over arrays, processing items in a list, or executing the same set of instructions multiple times. They contribute to the efficiency and readability of your code by allowing you to express repetitive logic concisely.
